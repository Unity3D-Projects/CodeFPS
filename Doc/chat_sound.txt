Good to see you might, take one of the rifles from the table.
You know the rule. Go to station 1 aim and put your rifle in downrange.
Now aim your rifle in downrange.
Now shot each target you're aiming inside.
Love that...
Now shot all of the targets on fire of the hit.
Now i will block out the target to shelter rifle.
I would you to shot the target through the wood. 
Bullet penetrate materials such as wood, plastic and sheet metal.
Good.
Now I'll let the targets pop up one by one.
Knock them down as fast as you can.
Well done, man!
Get a secondary weapon from the arsenal.
Good. Now switch to the rifle.
Take out the pistol.
Remember, changing to a pistol is always faster than changing a magazine.
